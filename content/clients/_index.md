Mortar Clients are no different then the standard ones, in fact they are the same.
Mortar only makes them conveniently configurable.

Before you continue, please make sure you are familiar with [Dependency Injection](/fx) and [Uber-Fx Groups](/fx/groups).

Mortar supports the following clients out-of-the-box.

* [gRPC](/clients/grpc)
* [HTTP](/clients/http)
