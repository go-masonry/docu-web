Welcome to Mortar Documentation.

Mortar is a GO framework/library for building gRPC (and REST) web services.
It has out-of-the-box support for configuration, application metrics, logging, tracing, profiling, dependency injection and more.

The simplest way to start is to clone the [Demo](https://github.com/go-masonry/mortar-demo) repository.
